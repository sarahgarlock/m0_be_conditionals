# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel confident, I understand the structure of it but I would imagine not all cases are this black and white. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Confident, either both are true (&&) or one or both are true (||)
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Fairly confident. I have found myself writing them then realizing there is a much easier way to write them after. Hoping this gets easier and more fluent.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Not a ton of time, I was able to do all the code_challenges with no problems. I actually really enjoyed it
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I'd like to practice more complex if statements, I think adding some time into my calendar would be appropiate for that. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None so far, just more practice to make everything second nature
